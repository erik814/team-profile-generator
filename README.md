# Team Sheet Generator

## Description

This is an application to allow a business owner to make an html webpage that lists their employees.

To use it, the user would type 'node index.js' into the terminal. They will then be able to select the option to add an employee. From there they will select what role the employee servers. Finally, they be asked a series of questions for various info about the employee. When they are done, they can either choose to add another employee, or generate their page.

## Tasks

For this project, we weren't given any starter code. I had to create my own file directory, and install the appropriate node packages.

## What I Learned

In doing this project, I learned how to use jest and classes/subclasses. The biggest hurdle for me was figuring out how to get the forEach loop to work in the middle of template literals.
